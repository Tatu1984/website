## 🔧 Environment Variables

Already configured in `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=nwa9weet
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
```

**You'll add these to Vercel/Netlify during deployment.**

---

## 🌐 DNS Configuration (Summary)

When you deploy, you'll add these DNS records:

**A Record:**
- Type: `A`

## 🎯 After Deployment

Once live, your users can:

1. **Visit:** `https://www.infinititechpartners.com`
2. **Click "HRMS Login"** (top right)
3. **Login** with credentials (currently accepts any - you'll connect real HRMS)
4. **Access Dashboard** with 6 modules

---

## 🔐 HRMS Integration Next Steps

The HRMS portal is ready but uses placeholder authentication.

**To connect your real HRMS:**

1. Edit: `app/api/hrms/auth/login/route.ts`
2. Replace mock auth with your HRMS API call
3. Add environment variables for HRMS credentials
4. Update dashboard to fetch real data

*See TODO comments in the code for details.*
